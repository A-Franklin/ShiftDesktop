# Windows 10 Virtual Desktop Switcher

Tiny utility to simplify switching to the next/previous Windows 10 virtual desktop from a hotkey, script or command line. Also, can show the Windows Application Switcher.

## Command-Line Arguments

Use with arguments below (not case-sensitive) to immediately perform the shift and exit:

- `/L` Shifts left to previous desktop, by sending the Ctrl+Win+Left key combo
- `/R` Shifts right to next desktop, by sending the Ctrl+Win+Right key combo
- `/A` Shows the Windows Application Switcher with all desktops, by sending the Ctrl+Tab combo

## Integration with Other .NET Projects

If you have a project this would work in and don't want to include the source code directly, you can directly call the `public static` methods of this assembly in your code. After adding a project reference to this assembly, you can call the methods like:
```
// Shift to the previous desktop (left)
ShiftDesktop.ShiftForm.ShiftDesktopLeft();

// Shift to the next desktop (right)
ShiftDesktop.ShiftForm.ShiftDesktopRight();

// Show the Windows Application Switcher
ShiftDesktop.ShiftForm.ShowApplicationSwitcher();
```

## Using with a Mouse

I originally wrote this as a way to assign these functions to the thumb-wheel on my Logitech MX Revolution mouse. I had looked at UberOptions and a few scripting solutions, but it's near-impossible to script a Windows key combination (purposely, I imagine). Now I can shift between virtual desktops without moving my hand off the mouse. 

If you're interested in doing the same, here's how:

1. Compile this project to an .exe
2. Create shortcuts to that .exe with the command-line arguments in the shortcut. Maybe you can skip this step, if your mouse software is good at passing along arguments. Mine wasn't.
3. In the mouse-configuration software, choose to run a program as the button/wheel's action, and browse to the shortcut you created above.
